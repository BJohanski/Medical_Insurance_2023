# Medical_Insurance_2023
  Hi there,

  This repository includes my analysis of a set of US medical insurance data, provided by Codecademy.
  
  Included here is the initial dataset, a cleaned dataset ('insurance_results.csv'), and the python script which I have created for analysis and data tidying.

  Below is a link to a Tableau dashboard which includes some findings relating to the impacts of smoking on medical charges:

  I appreciate any and all feedback relating to my code, or the dashboard I've created. Thank you!
