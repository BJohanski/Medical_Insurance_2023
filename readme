Hi there,

This repository includes some analysis I have recently completed on a dataset of US health insurance.

This includes the initial dataset, a cleaned dataset ('insurance_results.csv'), and the python script which I have created for analysis and tidying.

Additionally I have created a Tableau dashboard which includes some findings relating to the impacts of smoking on medical charges. It can be found via the link below:

Thank you!
